# This workflow contains all Treadmill-based hardware CI jobs.
#
# Treadmill is a distributed hardware testbed developed within the Tock OS
# project. For more information on Treadmill, have a look at its documentation
# [1] or repository [2].
#
# This workflow is based on the Treadmill GitHub Actions integration guide [3].
# In addition, it features the ability to run multiple Treadmill jobs and
# test-execute stages through GitHub Action's job matrices, and uses a GitHub
# environment to allow deployments with access to secrets for select PRs.

      # Add any additional branches you want to include

  # Pull requests from forks will not have access to the required GitHub API
  # secrets below, even if they are using an appropriate deployment environment
  # and the workflow runs have been approved according to this environment's
  # rules. We don't know whether this is a bug on GitHub's end or deliberate.
  # Either way, for now we disable this workflow to run on PRs until we have
  # an API proxy that securely performs these GitHub API calls (adding runners
  # and starting Treadmill jobs with those runner registration tokens), which
  # allows this workflow to run without access to repository secrets.
