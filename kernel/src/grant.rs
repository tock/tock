//! Support for processes granting memory from their allocations to the kernel.
//!
//! ## Grant Overview
//!
//! Grants allow capsules to dynamically allocate memory from a process to hold
//! state on the process's behalf.
//!
//! Each capsule that wishes to do this needs to have a [`Grant`] type. Grants
//! are created at boot, and each have a unique ID and a type `T`. This type
//! only allows the capsule to allocate memory from a process in the future. It
//! does not initially represent any allocated memory.
//!
//! When a capsule does wish to use its Grant to allocate memory from a process,
//! it must "enter" the Grant with a specific [`ProcessId`]. Entering a Grant
//! for a specific process instructs the core kernel to create an object `T` in
//! the process's memory space and provide the capsule with access to it. If the
//! Grant has not previously been entered for that process, the memory for
//! object `T` will be allocated from the "grant region" within the
//! kernel-accessible portion of the process's memory.
//!
//! If a Grant has never been entered for a process, the object `T` will _not_
//! be allocated in that process's grant region, even if the `Grant` has been
//! entered for other processes.
//!
//! Upcalls and allowed buffer references are stored in the dynamically
//! allocated grant for a particular Driver as well. Upcalls and allowed buffer
//! references are stored outside of the `T` object to enable the kernel to
//! manage them and ensure swapping guarantees are met.
//!
//! The type `T` of a Grant is fixed in size and the number of upcalls and
//! allowed buffers associated with a grant is fixed. That is, when a Grant is
//! entered for a process the resulting allocated object will be the size of
//! `SizeOf<T>` plus the size for the structure to hold upcalls and allowed
//! buffer references. If capsules need additional process-specific memory for
//! their operation, they can use an [`GrantRegionAllocator`] to request
//! additional memory from the process's grant region.

                // code, it balances usability with type correctness. The
                // challenge is that calling `self.apps.iter()` is a common
                // pattern in capsules to access the grant region of every app
                // that is using the capsule, and sometimes it is intuitive to
                // call that inside of a `self.apps.enter(processid, |app| {...})`
                // closure. However, `.enter()` means that app's grant region is
                // entered, and then a naive `.iter()` would re-enter the grant
                // region and cause undefined behavior. We considered different
                // options to resolve this.
                //
                // 1. Have `.iter()` only iterate over grant regions which are
                //    not entered. This avoids the bug, but could lead to
                //    unexpected behavior, as `self.apps.iter()` will do
                //    different things depending on where in a capsule it is
                //    called.
                // 2. Have the compiler detect when `.iter()` is called when a
                //    grant region has already been entered. We don't know of a
                //    viable way to implement this.
                // 3. Panic if `.iter()` is called when a grant is already
                //    entered.
                //
                // We decided on option 3 because it balances minimizing
                // surprises (`self.apps.iter()` will always iterate all grants)
                // while also protecting against the bug. We expect that any
                // code that attempts to call `self.apps.iter()` after calling
                // `.enter()` will immediately encounter this `panic!()` and
