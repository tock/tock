Tock courses
==================

---
**NOTE**
These courses all use Tock version 1 (e.g., 1.2, 1.3). 
Tock development is currently on version 2. 
The major difference between the two versions is the
system call ABI/API. If you are interested in writing applications on Tock,
the changes appear very small, as userspace libraries hide the differences.
The differences between version 1 and version 2 are most significant if you
want to write system call drivers for kernel services.

We hope to write a course for version 2 soon. Until then, the 
[Tock book](https://book.tockos.org/) is a good place to start.

Courses are a great way to start learning Tock. They take you to the entire
process of getting started, writing an application, and adding a capsule to the
kernel. There are currently three different courses available, corresponding to
the three conferences we've given workshops at:

- **[RustConf](rustconf)** - For the user familiar with Rust.
- **[Sensys](2018-11-SenSys)** - For the user familiar with embedded networked sensor systems.
- **[SOSP](sosp)** - For the user familiar with operating systems.
