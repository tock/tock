//! Interface for Key-Value (KV) Stores
//!
//! The KV store implementation in Tock has two levels:
//!
//! 1. **KV Level**: This level provides a standard key-value interface with
//!    common get/set/add/update/delete operations.
//!
//! 2. **KV Permissions Level**: This level mirrors the `KV` interface, but each
//!    call requires storage permissions. This permits implementing access
//!    control permissions with key-value stores in Tock.
//!
//! The expected setup inside Tock will look like this:
//!
//! ```text
