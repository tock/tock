//! Interface for CAN peripherals.
//!
//! Defines multiple traits for different purposes.
//!
//! The `Configure` trait is used to configure the communication
//! mode and bit timing parameters of the CAN peripheral. The
//! `ConfigureFd` trait is an advanced feature that can be implemented
//! for peripherals that support flexible data messages. These
//! 2 traits represent synchronous actions and do not need a client
//! in order to confirm to the capsule that the action is finished.
//!
//! The `Controller` trait is used to enable and disable the device.
//! In order to be able to enable the device, the bit timing parameters
//! and the communication mode must be previously set, and in order
//! to disable the device, it must be enabled. This trait defines
//! asynchronous behaviours and because of that, the `ControllerClient`
//! trait is used to confirm to the capsule that the action is finished.
//!
//! The `Filter` trait is used to configure filter banks for receiving
//! messages. The action is synchronous.
//!
//! The `Transmit` trait is used to asynchronously send a message on
//! the CAN bus. The device must be previously enabled. The
//! `TransmitClient` trait is used to notify the capsule when the
//! transmission is done or when there was en error captured during
//! the transmission.
//!
//! The `Receive` trait is used to asynchronously receive messages on
//! the CAN bus. The `ReceiveClient` trait is used to notify the capsule
//! when a message was received, when the receiving process was aborted
//! and anytime an error occurs.
//!
