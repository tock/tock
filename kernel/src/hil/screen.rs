//! Interface for screens and displays.
//!
//! The interfaces exposed here cover both configurable (`ScreenSetup`), and
//! less configurable hardware (only `Screen`).
//!
//! It's composed of 4 main kinds of requests:
//! - set power,
//! - read configuration (e.g. `get_resolution`),
//! - configure (e.g. `set_invert`),
//! - write buffer.
//!
//! All requests, except for `Screen::set_power`, can return `OFF` under some
//! circumstances.
//!
//! For buffer writes, it's when the display is powered off.
//!
//! While the display is not powered on, the user could try to configure it. In
//! that case, the driver MUST either cache the value, or return `OFF`. This is
//! to let the user power the display in the desired configuration.
//!
//! Configuration reads shall return the actual state of the display. In
//! situations where a parameter cannot be configured (e.g. fixed resolution),
//! they return value may be hardcoded. Otherwise, the driver should query the
//! hardware directly, and return OFF if it's not powered.
//!
//! Configuration sets cause a `command_complete` callback unless noted
//! otherwise.
