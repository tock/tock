/// memory for a particular data structure.
///
/// This macro creates the static buffer, ensures it is initialized to the

///
/// Note: Because this instantiates a static object, you generally cannot pass

/// # Safety
///
/// As this macro will write directly to a global area without acquiring a lock
/// or similar, calling this macro is inherently unsafe. The caller should take
/// care to never call the code that initializes this buffer twice, as doing so
/// will overwrite the value from first allocation without running its
/// destructor.

///
/// This function is implemented separately without inlining to removes the size

/// then you have tried to initialize the same static memory twice. This is

/// [`static_buf!()`](crate::static_buf) in a loop or calling a function
/// multiple times which internally contains a call to
/// [`static_buf!()`](crate::static_buf). Typically, calls to
