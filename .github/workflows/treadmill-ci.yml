# This workflow contains all Treadmill-based hardware CI jobs.
#
# Treadmill is a distributed hardware testbed developed within the Tock OS
# project. For more information on Treadmill, have a look at its documentation
# [1] or repository [2].
#
# This workflow is based on the Treadmill GitHub Actions integration guide [3].
# In addition, it features the ability to run multiple Treadmill jobs and
# test-execute stages through GitHub Action's job matrices, and uses a GitHub
# environment to allow deployments with access to secrets for select PRs.
