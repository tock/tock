/// Userspace process identifier.
///
/// This is an opaque type that can be used to represent a running process on
/// the board without requiring an actual reference to a `Process` object.
/// Having this `ProcessId` reference type is useful for managing ownership and
/// type issues in Rust, but more importantly `ProcessId` serves as a tool for
/// capsules to hold pointers to applications.
///
/// Since `ProcessId` implements `Copy`, having an `ProcessId` does _not_ ensure
/// that the process the `ProcessId` refers to is still valid. The process may
/// have been removed, terminated, or restarted as a new process. Therefore, all
/// uses of `ProcessId` in the kernel must check that the `ProcessId` is still
/// valid. This check happens automatically when `.index()` is called, as noted
/// by the return type: `Option<usize>`. `.index()` will return the index of the
/// process in the processes array, but if the process no longer exists then
/// `None` is returned.
///
/// Outside of the kernel crate, holders of an `ProcessId` may want to use
/// `.id()` to retrieve a simple identifier for the process that can be
/// communicated over a UART bus or syscall interface. This call is guaranteed
/// to return a suitable identifier for the `ProcessId`, but does not check that
/// the corresponding application still exists.
///
/// This type also provides capsules an interface for interacting with processes
/// since they otherwise would have no reference to a `Process`. Very limited
/// operations are available through this interface since capsules should not
/// need to know the details of any given process. However, certain information
/// makes certain capsules possible to implement. For example, capsules can use
/// the `get_editable_flash_range()` function so they can safely allow an app to
/// modify its own flash.
