/// memory for a particular data structure.
///
/// This macro creates the static buffer, ensures it is initialized to the
/// proper type, and then returns a `&'static mut` reference to it.
///
/// Note: Because this instantiates a static object, you generally cannot pass
/// a type with generic parameters. github.com/tock/tock/issues/2995 for detail.

/// # Safety
///
/// As this macro will write directly to a global area without acquiring a lock
/// or similar, calling this macro is inherently unsafe. The caller should take
/// care to never call the code that initializes this buffer twice, as doing so
/// will overwrite the value from first allocation without running its
/// destructor.

/// This function is implemented separately without inlining to removes the size
