# Tock uses rustfmt's default configuration for formatting style.

# Configure rustfmt to error when it cannot format a file. This helps avoid
# issues where rust code is silently not formatted because rustfmt encounters
# something it cannot format. Typically, this happens when a comment is inserted
# somewhere that rustfmt doesn't handle.
error_on_unformatted = true

# This configuration file is important so that when rustfmt is run within this
# repository, it does not search parent directories for a rustfmt.toml file.
# This allows projects with their own rustfmt.toml file to include tock as a
# submodule without changing the behavior of `make prepush`.
