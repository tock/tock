# In general, Tock discourages the use of cargo features. However for certain
# kernel crate configuration, we have not found reasonable alternatives to
# setting boolean values in kernel/src/config.rs. To make those settings configurable
# without requiring users to modify the kernel crate itself, we allow configuration of
# the values of the global CONFIG constant in kernel/src/config.rs via these features.
# Other uses of cargo features are disallowed.*
#
# To use these features, modify your dependency on the kernel crate as follows:
# ```rust
# [dependencies]
# kernel = { path = "../../kernel", features = ["no_debug_panics"] }
# ```
#
# You should only modify the dependency on the kernel crate from your "board"
# crate, as feature unification will ensure that a feature being set by a single
# crate will lead to the feature being enabled for that dependency.
#
# *The `flux` feature here is an exception, due to limitations of cargo's
# dev-dependency mechanism, see doc/ExternalDependencies.md#flux-rs for details.
