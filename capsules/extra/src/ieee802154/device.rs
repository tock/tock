//! The contract satisfied by an implementation of an IEEE 802.15.4 MAC device.
//! Any IEEE 802.15.4 MAC device should expose the following high-level
//! functionality:
//!
//! - Configuration of addresses and transmit power
//! - Preparing frames (data frame, command frames, beacon frames)
//! - Transmitting and receiving frames
//!
//! Outlining this in a trait allows other implementations of MAC devices that
//! divide the responsibilities of software and hardware differently. For
//! example, a radio chip might be able to completely inline the frame security
//! procedure in hardware, as opposed to requiring a software implementation.
