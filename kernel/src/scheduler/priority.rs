//! Fixed Priority Scheduler for Tock
//!
//! This scheduler assigns priority to processes based on their order in the
//! `PROCESSES` array, and runs the highest priority process available at any
//! point in time. Kernel tasks (bottom half interrupt handling / deferred call
//! handling) always take priority over userspace processes.
//!
//! Notably, there is no need to enforce timeslices, as it is impossible for a
//! process running to not be the highest priority process at any point while it
//! is running. The only way for a process to longer be the highest priority is
//! for an interrupt to occur, which will cause the process to stop running.
