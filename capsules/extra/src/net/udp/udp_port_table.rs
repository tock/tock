//! In-kernel structure for tracking UDP ports bound by capsules.
//!
//! When kernel capsules wish to send or receive UDP packets, the UDP sending / receiving
//! capsules will only allow this if the capsule has bound to the port it wishes to
//! send from / receive on. Binding to a port is accomplished via calls on the
//! `UdpPortManager` struct defined in this file. Calls to bind on this table enforce that only
//! one capsule can be bound to a given port at any time. Once capsules successfully bind
//! using this table, they receive back binding structures (`UdpPortBindingTx`/`UdpPortBindingRx`)
//! that act as proof that the holder
//! is bound to that port. These structures can only be created within this file, and calls
//! to unbind must consume these structures, enforcing this invariant.
//! The UDP tx/rx capsules require these bindings be passed in order to send/receive on a given
//! port. Separate bindings are used for sending and receiving because the UdpReceiver must
//! hold onto the binding for as long as a capsule wishes to receive packets on a port, so
//! a separate binding must be available to enable sending packets on a port while
//! listening on the same port.
//!
//! To reduce the size of data structures required for this task, a fixed size
//! array is used to store bindings in the kernel. This means that a limited
//! number of bindings can be stored at any point in time. Reserving a slot
//! in this table is done by requesting a socket, which represents a reserved slot.
//! These sockets are then used to request bindings on a particular port.
//!
//! This file only stores information about which ports are bound by capsules.
//! The files `udp_send.rs` and `udp_recv.rs` enforce that only capsules possessing
//! the correct bindings can actually send / recv on a given port.
//!
//! Userspace port bindings are managed separately by the userspace UDP driver
//! (`capsules/src/net/udp/driver.rs`), because apps can be dynamically added or
//! removed. Bindings for userspace apps are stored in the grant regions of each app,
//! such that removing an app automatically unbinds it. This file is able to query the
//! userspace UDP driver to check which ports are bound, and vice-versa, such that
//! exclusive access to ports between userspace apps and capsules is still enforced.
