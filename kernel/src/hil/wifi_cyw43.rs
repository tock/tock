//! Interface for CYW43439 WiFi devices
//!
//! Access point (AP) and station (STA) functionalities are split into
//! two traits. Concurrent access point and station (STA+AP)
//! configuration should be up to the device if it supports it.
//! Joining or starting a network are asynchronous operations.
//! Leaving or stopping the network operations are, on the other side,
//! synchronous, as the CYW43439 devices don't seem to emit any events
//! upon requesting these operations.
//!
//! The `Scanner` trait is used for scanning devices on the network.
//! The scanner client should be called when a network is found and
//! the SSID is provided. The client should be notified when the
//! CYW43439 device sends an event that implies that the scan is done.
//! Regardless, the device should also request synchronously to stop
//! scanning so that other scan-related events are disabled.
//!
//! Device initialisation is done asynchronously and moved into
//! a separate trait `WifiCtrl`. After initialisation, the device
//! should provide its MAC address.
