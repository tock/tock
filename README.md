Tock is an embedded operating system designed for running multiple concurrent,
mutually distrustful applications on Cortex-M and RISC-V based embedded
platforms. Tock's design centers around protection, both from potentially
malicious applications and from device drivers. Tock uses two mechanisms to
protect different components of the operating system. First, the kernel and
device drivers are written in Rust, a systems programming language that provides
compile-time memory safety and type safety. Tock uses Rust to protect the kernel
(e.g. the scheduler and hardware abstraction layer) from platform specific
device drivers as well as isolate device drivers from each other. Second, Tock
uses memory protection units to isolate applications from each other and the
kernel.

<p>This is the primary paper that describes the design considerations of Tock.</p>

  <summary>Other Tock-related papers</summary>

  <p>There are two shorter papers that look at potential limitations of the Rust language for embedded software development. The earlier PLOS paper lays out challenges and the later APSys paper lays out potential solutions. Some persons describing work on programming languages and type theory may benefit from these references, but generally, most work should cite the SOSP paper above.</p>

  <p>There is also a paper on the Tock security model. The threat model documentation in the docs/ folder is the source of truth for the current Tock threat model, but this paper represents a snapshot of the reasoning behind the Tock threat model and details how it compares to those in similar embedded OSes.</p>
