# Raspberry Pi Pico W

The [Raspberry Pi Pico W](https://datasheets.raspberrypi.com/picow/pico-w-product-brief.pdf) is a
board developed by the Raspberry Pi Foundation and is based on the RP2040 chip.

In order to get started, you can follow the [Raspberry Pi Pico guide](../raspberry_pi_pico/README.md).
This board is almost identical to the main one, with the key difference being Wi-Fi capabilities
provided by the on-board Infineon CYW43439 chip.
